ShortcutFixer.exe is an executable file associated with Glary Utilities, a system optimization software developed by Glarysoft Ltd., and it is designed to help users fix broken shortcuts on their Windows operating systems. The latest version, 5.0.0.38, is generally considered safe to use, as it is part of a reputable suite of tools aimed at improving system performance and user experience. However, like any executable file, it can potentially be flagged by antivirus programs if it is altered or if the system is infected by malware that disguises itself under a similar name. Users may encounter errors related to ShortcutFixer.exe if the Glary Utilities software is not properly installed, if there are compatibility issues with the operating system, or if the file itself has become corrupted. Overall, while ShortcutFixer.exe serves a legitimate purpose within its software framework, users should always ensure that they download it from trusted sources and keep their antivirus software updated to mitigate any risks.
